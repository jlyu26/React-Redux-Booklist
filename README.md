The app is divided into two separate parts: the data that powers the app, and the views that display that data. We want to separate the views in our application from the data in our application. **Redux** is the data contained inside this application box, whereas **React** is the views contained in the application box. 

When Redux describes itself as a **state container**, it means a collection of all the data that describes the app that not only includes the hard data, like the list of books, but it also includes more meta-level properties, like the currently selected book. React on the other hand represents the views, which translates the app's data into something that can be displayed on the screen and user can acturally interact with. 

The difference from other frameworks is here we **centralize all of the application's data inside of a single object, which referred to as the state**. One of the most important parts of creating a Redux application is figuring out how to design state.

## Terminologies

**1. Reducer**

A reducer is a function that returns a piece of the application state. Because our application can have different piecs of states, we can have many different reducers. 

```
// Application State - Generated by Reducers
{
	books: [{title: 'Harry Potter'},{title: 'JavaScript'}],	// Book Reducer
	activeBook: {title: 'JavaScript: The Good Parts'} // ActiveBook Reducer
}
```

A reducer is created on application in a two step process: 1. create the reducer; 2. wire it into application.

**2. React Redux: Combine React Views and Redux State**

React and Redux are tow separate libraries, to connect them, use another separate library "React Redux", `npm install --save react-redux`. To make use of "React Redux" we need to define/promote one of our components as a **container** instead of a component. The only time we get this bridge available where we can take a React component and **inject state** into it.

**3. Container**

A container, sometimes called **"smart component"** in contrast to regular "dumb components", is a React component that has a direct connection to the state managed by Redux. To indicate the difference, we usually separate them into different directories.

Question: Which components do we promote to be the container and which do we leave as normal components?
